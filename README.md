# MegaHQ MMR
Hi, and welcome to MegaHQ - Mega Man Rice, a Mega Man ricing setup, it is a theme in itself, utilizing a defined color palette, with tints, shades and much more.

MegaHQ is a futuristic tech theme, with focus on utilizing UI elements similar to those featured in the Mega Man franchise, although its main color palette would consist of blue and red, orange seems to be a more fitting color, alongside tints and variations, even sometimes green is perfect when you need an accent.

The ricing part of the theme is intended to be done using Hyprland, but I also recommend a few other programs alongisde to give your system the full MMR theme.

## Color palettes, recommended software and the Wiki

> ["You should check me out!"](https://github.com/Exzmerald/MegaHQ/wiki) <sub> -The wiki, probably.</sub>

If you want to understand what's going on, since this is intended to be a "first time" rice, the wiki will guide you on how to apply the rice, if you want information about the color palette and design paradigm, it can also be found there.
